# Caritas Online-Beratung VideoService

With the help of the VideoService it is possible for consultants to stop and initiate (Jitsi) videocalls (via the VideoBackend). It handles the creation of JSON web tokens to authorize askers and consultants (with moderator privilege). These token also define the duration validity and as well provide guest links for anonymous users to join the call.
